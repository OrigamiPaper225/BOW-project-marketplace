                    The BOW Project Marketplace is a platform empowering project-seekers and project-creators within the BOW community to connect and strengthen the Babson-Wellesley-Olin nexus. With students from each respective school harboring various interdisciplinary skills and passions, the BOW Project Marketplace seeks to use collaboration to further on-campus student projects and establish new bonds and friendships between these students.

                    We decided to go in the direction of designing a platform to share and find projects. Our current design is a low-fidelity Figma prototype where BOW students can create a post containing project information and browse different projects to see what projects are going on in the BOW community. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Each project information post contains details such as description, image, contact, organizers, location of meetings, upcoming events, etc. When searching for projects, users can either search for a specific keyword/category or browse general projects and apply filters to results such as category, location, etc.</p>

                    Many of these frames were selected from a collection of other potential designs/sketches; a great example of this is with the Project Summary page, arguably the most important page on the site, and the one that went through multiple iterations.

                    First, we will discuss how this design works, how it is or isn’t able to meet user needs, and why we chose this design over the alternatives.

                    Our home page provides a conceptual model over what this page is for, with the emphasis on the Explore button for project-seekers making project team pages like this discoverable.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This page displays a summary of a BOW project, including the team name, location, category, members list, email, events, description, and similar groups. This is complemented with either an image or trailer of the project above the about description, where it is up to the project creator to decide. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    While this page doesn’t have too many affordances, some possible actions include returning to the explore page, scrolling to see additional information, and access to the navigation bar. The search bar affords the ability to type in project ideas, themes, types, etc. This is signified by both the search symbol and hint of “Search projects, people, categories here.”
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interactionflow">
                <img src="assets/css/images/searchbar.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Within the interaction flow, the search bar was supposed to be an emphasized and prominent feature that users first look towards when getting on the site. One issue with the current search bar is its lack of significance (with the sheer quantity of sites also including search bars, it doesn’t stand out), with no hints about its importance. Thus, part of our conceptual model was not fully conveyed. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This could be solved by including a tutorial for first-time users, having arrows with descriptions pointing at the site’s features, and asking the user to type a project category/friend within the search bar to find a project. Properly encoding the abilities and significance of the search bar for first-time users will be crucial for their later use of the platform.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The main focus of this page is to display information, thus, we’ve included many signifiers to help users discern what some of the listed information means. Under the project team name, information such as the location, members list, and contact email are all paired with icons, many being culturally understood as signifying their respective information type.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interactionflow">
                <img src="assets/css/images/ex3.png">

            <div>
                <p>
                    This clear and concise summary of information helps address a user’s need of understanding what a certain BOW project is about, while also enabling communication between the user and the project team by listing their contact information and event schedule. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We utilized natural mapping for scrolling down to see more information about the company (on a 1920x1080 screen, you cannot view the entire frame) and for seeming more similar groups. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interactionflow">
                <img src="assets/css/images/ex4.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We do not want users to experience information overload, thus, we have included logical constraints, not showing additional information like similar groups unless the user scrolls down to it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This natural correspondence where moving the scroll bar right or down shows more information in that direction, matching the user’s movement. With Jakob’s law, as many sites use similar natural and intuitive mapping for scrolling, users are able to apply their intuitive expectations toward our product as well.
                </p>

                    Another team member created the following design, being heavily inspired by Crunchbase from the Inspirational Designs submission. Much of the same affordances, signifiers, and page structure was included from Crunchbase.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interactionflow">
                <img src="assets/css/images/ex2.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    While this version included more affordances and information as a whole, for our goal of giving users a brief summary of a project, this was overdoing it. The Crunchbase site that this variation was inspired from is meant to display information for full-on companies, meaning much more information is required. This is why they included more constraints, splitting information into three tabs that can only be viewed one at a time.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interactionflow">
                <img src="assets/css/images/ex5.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    For the student projects that we are summarizing, there is no such need for this much information, which is why irrelevant tabs like “Commitment levels” or “Recruit” were created to fill the empty space. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This was a key insight for the team, that having more affordances does not necessarily mean a better website, and that various user needs require different levels of constraint.
