                    The BOW Project Marketplace is a platform that empowers project seekers and project creators within the BOW community to connect and strengthen the Babson-Wellesley-Olin nexus. With students from each school specializing in a variety of interdisciplinary skills and passions, the BOW Project Marketplace fosters collaboration between schools to further on-campus student projects and establish new bonds and friendships between students.

                    With our team composed of Olin and Babson students, we relate about the lack of a sense of community between all three schools. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From interviews with BOW students, we learned that current barriers to BOW projects were lack of time, the required energy to coordinate among schools, and differences in working styles. We also learned that students had a wide range of areas they were interested in. Considering these insights, we decided that our design needed to minimize the required energy to learn about and join projects.

                <p>
                    Our target group is undergraduate BOW students who want serious single semester projects where they find dedicated colleagues (Babson persona), fun projects to meet people (Olin persona), or a mix of both at other BOW colleges (Wellesley persona). These BOW students are looking to join a project while they are in college to work on specific skills and explore projects in various areas not limited to engineering or business.

                <p>
                    Based on interviews and an interest level breakdown (Figure 1), we were able to understand our user needs better, creating example personas that can be seen in Figure 2.

                <p>
                    With the aid of our design artifacts and interviews from the Needs Analysis, we decided to create a platform designed for students who feel restricted or intimidated by the currently available methods to collaborate, the activation energy required to look for opportunities, and the ways people communicate across colleges. 

                    <br><br>Our platform will help project leaders provide opportunities for interested students to join their project, whether it is still in the concept phase or if it is an existing team that’s looking to recruit new members and interdisciplinary skills.

                    <br><br>We further narrowed the scope of the projects that we wanted to serve: projects that span a semester or more but do not continue after college. 

                    <br><br>This means we would be serving current BOW students looking for projects or recruiting for their projects, excluding one-time events like workshops or longer-term projects like startups by BOW alums. 

                    <br><br>By narrowing our focus to medium-duration projects within the BOW community, the BOW Project Marketplace will be better able to serve current BOW students looking to collaborate on projects outside of class.

                    <br><br>All in all, we now knew what we’d do with BOW PM: create a platform where BOW students can create a post containing information about their projects and browse different projects active in the BOW community. 
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    With the previously mentioned goal in mind for our specific user group, we began thinking of features and high-level concepts that the BOW PM would feature.

                    <br><br>The result of our thinking is best seen through our interaction flow, as seen in figure 3, displaying our information architecture and planned pages for the site.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>

                <strong>Figure 3: Interactive flow chart</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    As seen in figure 3, our site’s higher-level concepts include exploring ongoing projects, creating projects, and searching for specific projects. We created an interaction flow that includes specific actions a user would want to take and the corresponding page/feature of our site. This helps us think through how a user might interact with our site and make sure our site provides specific features to allow them to find what they are looking for.

                    <br><br>The reason we came to our higher-level concepts of Explore Project, Search bar, and Create Project was because we learned from our previous phase that there are several different types of students: students who want to join projects in the BOW community, students who don’t have time or don’t want to, and students who want to post and promote their projects. We created those higher-level concepts to meet the needs of each group of students.

                    <br><br>We were originally going to include a social media function but decided not to include because one of the main takeaways from engaging with students is that this platform should be easy and require minimal activation energy to use. We wanted to stick with the basic information about projects, and if students are interested in learning more, they can reach out to the leaders or go to a meeting.

                    <br><br>The Explore Project concept addresses the needs of students that are curious to see different areas of work or students that do not want to join a team but are still interested to see the projects that others are working on. These are students who responded with low interest in our survey question.

                    <br><br>The Search Bar concept meets the needs of students that know the specific type of project or area of interest that they want to join. They do not need to spend extra time scrolling through projects on the explore page and can instead directly see relevant projects to join.

                    <br><br>Both concepts lead to the project description, which contains elements that meet different user needs: users that have specific questions or want to message someone, users that want to learn more, and users that are interested in the project but don’t want to join, most likely because they don’t have the time. For the first group of users, the project description page contains contact information to reach out to the organizing members. For users that want to learn more but in a less intimidating way than directly reaching out to a member of the project, they can find relevant websites and social media links, or even attend an upcoming event. For the last group of users, they can save it and come back to it when they have more time, or find similar projects.

                    <br><br>The Create Projects concept is for users that want to promote their project. They can share basic information such as contact information, the type of work they are doing, and location. They can also promote specific upcoming events such as a competition, community event, exposition, etc.

                    After settling on the site’s information design, we began creating low-fidelity models which included different sketches and variations of the same page. This led us to choose some versions over others, which will be discussed in the next section. 

                    <br><br>The end result from building off our sketches and interaction flow model has resulted in the designs visible in the Figma embed and Appendix.

                <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p>Our home page (shown in Figure 5) provides a conceptual overview of the site’s purpose and intended use, with emphasis on the “Find a project” button for BOW students looking to join a project and the “Post a project” button for project organizers to share their projects. The “Find a project” button redirects users to the Browse page, where users can filter projects based on interests, and the “Post a project” button redirects to either the sign in or login page if the user is not logged in or directly to the New project form, where they can enter information about their project and post it. This makes the project overview page easily discoverable, the page of interest in this case study.</p>

                    The navigation bar, shown in Figure 6, enables the user to navigate to the Home, Browse, or My Projects page from anywhere on the site. The user can also navigate to their profile or the Login or Signup pages by clicking the circle in the right corner (the circle will eventually be replaced with a higher-fidelity representation of a profile picture or a Login/Signup button). The BOW PM logo also takes the user back to the home page.

                <p>
                    The search bar affords the user the ability to search projects by project names, keywords, etc., which is signified by both the search symbol and the text prompt “Search projects.” Like the links to the Home, Browse, and My Projects page, the search bar is located in the navigation bar so it can be accessed from anywhere on the site for the convenience of the user. Many of our inspirational designs from Phase 1 included search bars in the header, such as LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and Meetup; thus, the positioning of the search bar adheres to Jakob’s law.

                <h2>How the page works</h2>
                <p>
                    While this page doesn’t have too many affordances, some possible actions include the following: returning to the Browse page by clicking the back arrow and “Browse” button; emailing the primary organizer by clicking on the link next to the mail icon; visiting the project’s external website by clicking the link next to the web icon; sending an email to the primary organizer about a position by clicking the “Contact Organizer” button underneath the role description; scrolling horizontally to see similar projects; viewing any of the recommended similar projects by clicking the “View” button; navigating to the Home, Browse, or My Projects page via the navigation bar; searching projects by project name, keyword, etc. using the search bar. 
                    <br><br>The main focus of the Project Overview page is to display more information about the project the user clicked on than the preview provided on the Browse page; thus, we have included many signifiers to help users discern what some of the listed information means, as shown in Figure 8. Next to the Project image, information such as the project type, schools represented, list of organizers, contact email, and link to the project’s external website are all paired with icons, many being commonly understood as signifying their respective information type.

                    This clear and concise summary of information helps address the user’s need of understanding what a certain BOW project is about while enabling the user to communicate with the project organizer and learn more about the project from the external website. 
                    <br><br>We utilized natural mapping for scrolling down to see more information about the company (on a 1920x1080 screen, you cannot view the entire frame) and to view more similar projects, as shown in Figure 9.

                <p>
                    In order to avoid overloading the user with information, we included logical constraints by not showing additional information like similar groups unless the user scrolls down to the Similar Projects section. This natural correspondence, where moving the scroll bar right or down shows more information in that direction, matches the user’s movement. Because many sites use similar natural and intuitive mapping for scrolling, users are able to apply their intuitive expectations toward our product as well - our design adheres to Jakob’s Law.

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The lack of affordances compared to similar sites - for example, on AngelList, users can connect to companies through the site, save a list of companies, share a company page, and quite a bit more. In our case, we mainly settled for just providing information about the project, with the means of communication with the project team the primary organizer’s email address. Even though the projects this site is for do not require nearly the amount of affordances that job listing websites do, having some of these features would be helpful. We chose to keep things simple with fewer features because including affordances like AngelList’s would be extremely complicated. 
                    <br><br>Another shortcoming of this design is how many of the elements look extremely similar, with a generally uninteresting color scheme overall. We plan on improving upon both these shortcomings using feedback from usability testing.

                <h2>Case Study: Project Overview Page Design 2</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Another team member created the Project Overview page shown in Figure 10, which was heavily inspired by Crunchbase from the Inspirational Designs submission. Much of the same affordances, signifiers, and page structure were included from Crunchbase.

            <div>
                <p>While this version included more affordances and information as a whole, it was too complex of an interface for our goal of giving users a brief summary of a project. The Crunchbase site that this variation was inspired by (see Figure 11) is meant to display information for large, established companies, meaning much more information is available and useful to the user. This is why they included more constraints, splitting information into three tabs that can only be viewed one at a time.</p>

                <p>
                    For the student projects that we are summarizing, there is no such need for this much information, which is why tabs like “Commitment Levels” or “Recruit” were omitted from the final design, and Project Overview page 1 was chosen instead.

                <h2>Key Insights

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>One of our team’s key insights was that having more affordances does not necessarily result in a better user experience or a more intuitive user interface. In the case study above, we determined that giving the project seeker the amount of information that Crunchbase gives its users about an established company was both overwhelming and impractical. We also realized that requiring the project poster to generate the amount of content that Crunchbase features on their organization overview for an overview of a small-scale project might be overwhelming and discourage the user from posting the project at all. For these reasons, we simplified the interface to only include relevant information for a brief project overview, which avoids overwhelming project posters and project seekers by design.
                    <br><br>After receiving feedback on our submission for the previous phase, we identified the scope of the projects that we wanted to serve as projects that span a semester or more but do not continue after college. This means we would be serving current BOW students looking for projects or recruiting for their projects. This excludes one-time events like workshops or longer-term projects like startups by BOW alums. By narrowing our focus to medium-duration projects within the BOW community, the BOW Project Marketplace will be better able to serve current BOW students looking to collaborate on projects outside of class. </p>

                    Potential Future Changes

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>We might change the level of detail for project posts. Our current prototype features a save project button, which allows users to save projects that they are interested into a list that they can access later. This feature might provide users with a quick way to save projects they care about; however, it could also go unused and unnecessarily clutter the interface if the number of projects posted to the site is low enough that users are able to quickly access projects by searching or filtering on the browse page.
                    <br><br>The Members list on the project information page is another area of our interface that we might omit. It is intended to show users browsing projects who are working on a project. This might be useful for users who are looking to work with their friends or acquaintances. On the other hand, many BOW students do not know students from outside their college by name, so it may be a feature that results in more work for people posting projects (as they may feel obligated to enter the names of every member on their team) with very limited benefit.
                    <br><br>The calendar feature for project events might also be omitted, as we do not intend for the BOW Project Marketplace to be used to frequently update existing project members, but instead to connect project seekers with recruiting projects. However, the calendar feature could be useful for advertising recruiting events that project teams are hosting, which might serve project seekers who are intimidated by messaging a project lead directly.
